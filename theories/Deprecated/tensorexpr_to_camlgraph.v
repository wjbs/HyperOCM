(* Convert a [TensorList] to the corresponding hypergraph. 
  The conversion is, essentially, that contractions become 
  (internal) vertices, abstract tensors become hyperedges,
  deltas become free wires, and any free lower / upper indices
  in the abstract tensors become input / output vertices,
  respectively.

  Vertices are labeled by the [TypeIdx] from the contraction
  or input, while edges are labeled by the [AbsIdx] indexing
  their function.
  
  The inputs and outputs of the graph are given as lists
  of the registers (which should be free in the [TensorList])
  which should be the inputs and outputs of the graph. 
  
  Returns the generated graph, the mapping from registers
  to vertices, and the map from abtract tensors to edges
  (with abstract tensors here represented by their indices 
  in the [TensorList]'s list of abstract tensors).
  
  Note that the sums of the [TensorList] must be unique; 
  if they are not, the graph _may_ be correct but the
  returned maps will not. *)
